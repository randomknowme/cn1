SECTION A (10 Marks)
(a) Define the term Justice in human-human relationships.
Justice in human-human relationships means ensuring fairness, equality, and mutual respect among individuals. It involves recognizing the rights and responsibilities of each person and treating them with dignity to maintain harmony and happiness.

(b) Differentiate between intention and competence in Trust.

Intention refers to a person’s honesty, goodwill, and moral values, showing their desire to act in the best interest of others.
Competence refers to a person’s ability, skills, and knowledge to fulfill their promises and responsibilities effectively.
Both are necessary to build trust, as good intentions without competence or competence without ethical intention can lead to distrust.

(c) Define harmony in nature.
Harmony in nature refers to the balanced interaction between all living and non-living components of the environment, ensuring sustainability and coexistence. It allows ecosystems to function smoothly without overexploitation of resources.

(d) Mention any one example of mutual interaction in nature.
One example is pollination, where bees collect nectar from flowers for food while helping in the reproduction of plants by transferring pollen. This benefits both the bees and the plants.

(e) What is meant by ethical human conduct?
Ethical human conduct refers to behavior that is guided by moral values such as honesty, fairness, respect, and responsibility. It ensures that individuals act in ways that promote harmony, justice, and well-being in society.

# SECTION B
## QUESTION 1
(a) Difference Between Intention and Competence in Building Trust
Trust is built on two key factors: intention and competence.

Intention refers to a person's honesty, goodwill, and moral values. It reflects whether they genuinely care for others and act in their best interest.
Competence refers to a person's ability, skills, and knowledge to fulfill their promises and responsibilities. Even with good intentions, a person who lacks competence may fail to deliver results, leading to distrust.
Real-life Example:
A doctor may have the best intentions to save lives, but if they lack medical competence, patients will not trust them with their health. On the other hand, a highly skilled but unethical doctor who overcharges patients or prescribes unnecessary treatments will also lose trust.

(b) Meaning of Justice in Human Relationships and a Program for Its Fulfillment
Justice in human relationships means treating others with fairness, equality, and respect, ensuring that each person gets what they deserve. It involves recognizing the rights and responsibilities of individuals in a way that promotes harmony and well-being.

Program for Fulfillment:
To ensure mutual happiness, the following steps can be implemented:

Understanding Needs: Recognizing what is fair and just for both parties.
Open Communication: Encouraging dialogue to express concerns and expectations.
Mutual Respect: Treating others with dignity and acknowledging their contributions.
Balanced Decision-Making: Ensuring fairness in resolving conflicts or distributing resources.
Accountability: Holding individuals responsible for their actions to maintain trust and fairness.
By applying these principles, relationships can be strengthened, leading to long-term happiness for all involved.

## question 3
(a) Harmony in Nature and Contribution of Different Components

Harmony in nature refers to the balanced coexistence of all living and non-living components, ensuring the smooth functioning of ecosystems. Every element in nature plays a crucial role in maintaining this balance.

Contributions of Different Components:

Plants: Absorb carbon dioxide, release oxygen, and provide food and shelter for various organisms.
Animals: Help in pollination, seed dispersal, and maintaining population balance through food chains.
Microorganisms: Decompose organic matter, recycle nutrients, and maintain soil fertility.
Water Bodies: Support aquatic life, regulate temperature, and provide fresh water for survival.
Air and Atmosphere: Maintain climate stability and support respiration.
Each component interacts in a way that supports life, preventing overuse or depletion of resources, ensuring sustainability.

(b) Role of Recyclability and Self-Regulation in Maintaining Balance in Nature

Recyclability and self-regulation are two fundamental processes that maintain nature’s balance by ensuring resources are continuously reused and ecosystems remain stable.

Recyclability:

Natural processes like the carbon, nitrogen, and water cycles help in the reuse of essential elements.
Decomposers like bacteria and fungi break down dead organisms, returning nutrients to the soil, which plants reuse.
Self-Regulation:

Ecosystems regulate themselves through predator-prey relationships, population control, and natural selection.
If one species overpopulates, natural factors like food scarcity, diseases, or predators bring the numbers back to balance.
These mechanisms ensure that resources are not depleted and life continues to thrive sustainably on Earth.
