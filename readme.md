## QUESTION 2
(a) Difference Between Intention and Competence in Building Trust
**(a) Difference Between Intention and Competence in Building Trust**  

Trust is built on two key factors: **intention** and **competence**.  

- **Intention** refers to honesty, goodwill, and moral values. A person with good intentions genuinely cares for others and acts in their best interest.  
- **Competence** is the ability, skills, and knowledge to fulfill promises and responsibilities. Without competence, even good intentions may not be enough to gain trust.  

**Example:** A doctor with pure intentions but lacking medical expertise cannot be trusted with patients' health. Similarly, a highly skilled but unethical doctor who overcharges or prescribes unnecessary treatments will also lose trust.

**(b) Justice in Human Relationships & Its Fulfillment**  

Justice in relationships means treating others with **fairness, equality, and respect**, ensuring everyone gets what they deserve. It promotes harmony and well-being.  

**Program for Fulfillment:**  
1. **Understand Needs** – Recognize what is fair for all.  
2. **Open Communication** – Encourage dialogue to express concerns and expectations.  
3. **Mutual Respect** – Treat others with dignity and acknowledge their contributions.  
4. **Balanced Decision-Making** – Ensure fairness in resolving conflicts and sharing resources.  
5. **Accountability** – Hold individuals responsible for their actions to maintain trust and justice.  

## question 4
(a) Harmony in Nature and Contributions of Components

Harmony in nature is the balanced coexistence of all living and non-living elements, ensuring ecosystem stability.

Contributions:

Plants – Release oxygen, absorb CO₂, provide food and shelter.
Animals – Aid in pollination, seed dispersal, and food chain balance.
Microorganisms – Decompose matter, recycle nutrients, enrich soil.
Water Bodies – Support aquatic life, regulate temperature, provide fresh water.
Air & Atmosphere – Stabilize climate, support respiration.
Each component interacts to sustain life and prevent resource depletion.

(b) Recyclability & Self-Regulation in Nature’s Balance

These processes ensure resource reuse and ecosystem stability.

Recyclability: Natural cycles (carbon, nitrogen, water) recycle essential elements. Decomposers return nutrients to the soil.
Self-Regulation: Ecosystems maintain balance through predator-prey relationships, population control, and natural selection.
These mechanisms prevent depletion and sustain life on Earth.
These mechanisms ensure that resources are not depleted and life continues to thrive sustainably on Earth.




SECTION A (10 Marks)
(a) Define the term Justice in human-human relationships.
Justice in human-human relationships means ensuring fairness, equality, and mutual respect among individuals. It involves recognizing the rights and responsibilities of each person and treating them with dignity to maintain harmony and happiness.

(b) Differentiate between intention and competence in Trust.

Intention refers to a person’s honesty, goodwill, and moral values, showing their desire to act in the best interest of others.
Competence refers to a person’s ability, skills, and knowledge to fulfill their promises and responsibilities effectively.
Both are necessary to build trust, as good intentions without competence or competence without ethical intention can lead to distrust.

(c) Define harmony in nature.
Harmony in nature refers to the balanced interaction between all living and non-living components of the environment, ensuring sustainability and coexistence. It allows ecosystems to function smoothly without overexploitation of resources.

(d) Mention any one example of mutual interaction in nature.
One example is pollination, where bees collect nectar from flowers for food while helping in the reproduction of plants by transferring pollen. This benefits both the bees and the plants.

(e) What is meant by ethical human conduct?
Ethical human conduct refers to behavior that is guided by moral values such as honesty, fairness, respect, and responsibility. It ensures that individuals act in ways that promote harmony, justice, and well-being in society.
