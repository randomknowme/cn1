The Go-Back-N Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) protocol is a data link layer protocol that enhances communication efficiency and reliability by allowing the sender to transmit multiple frames before needing an acknowledgment for the first one. This method is a specific instance of the sliding window protocol, where the sender's window size is greater than one, and the receiver's window size is one.

Key Features of Go-Back-N ARQ:

Sliding Window Mechanism: The sender maintains a window of frames that can be sent without waiting for an acknowledgment. This window slides forward as acknowledgments are received, allowing continuous transmission of frames.

Sequential Frame Numbering: Frames are numbered sequentially to keep track of their order. If a frame is lost or arrives with errors, the receiver discards that frame and all subsequent frames until the missing one is correctly received.

Retransmission Strategy: Upon detecting a missing or erroneous frame, the sender retransmits the lost frame and all subsequent frames in the window, hence the term "Go-Back-N."
